COMPILE ON WINDOWS
------------------

You need to have MinGW installed, after that is just as simple as cd'ing in the directory where you
have downloaded the sources and type "make". No installation process is required up to now.


COMPILE ON LINUX
----------------

You need to tune up the Makefiles a little to reflect the Unix's hierarchy and standard extensions for
libraries and executables (s/.dll/.so/g, for example).
After that, to execute the compiled binary you have to manually specify the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
variable. For example, using Bash:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./Sensitive
