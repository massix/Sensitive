Sensitive is a Software to calculate and plot data statistics using Lagrange's polynomial or Newton's polynomial.
It is far from being complete, even if now ships with a decent and usable UI.



COMPILE ON WINDOWS
------------------

You need to have MinGW, Qt >= 4.7.0 and Qwt >= 6.0.0 installed.
Tune up the Qwt_qt_config.makefile, indicating the paths where you've installed your Qt and Qwt development files.
Cd where you;ve downloaded the Sensitive's sources and then type make. If everything is set ok, you'll end up having the
executable on the root directory. Remember that you MUST have Qwt.dll in your %PATH% or in the directory where the
exe is.


COMPILE ON LINUX
----------------

On Ubuntu 11.04, you can install the libqt4-dev package, but you have to compile Qwt from sources, since the version that is
shipped in the repositories is quite old. Tune up the Qwt_qt_config.makefile (if needed, the version shipped is already
configured for a standard Ubuntu installation of both libqt4-dev and qwt) and type make.
After that, you'll have the executable in the topmost directory of the sources. Remember to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
variable with the paths of the librenal.so, libgraphics.so and libqwt.so
(e.g.: 
  $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=".;/usr/local/qwt-6.0.1/lib" ./Sensitive
)


COMPILE ON OSX
--------------

Dunno, lol.



COMPILE ON IPHONE
------------------

You can't.


USAGE
-----

First of all, you have to select which polynomial form you'd like to use. After that, you'll be greeted by a maximized window
with the left side covered by a table where you can insert coordinates (you can fill it with double precision numbers). When the
table contains the coordinates you want, just click on "Interpole!" and let the software do the rest.
You can also drag&drop a .txt file containing the coordinates to the plot.
The .txt file must contain a couple of coordinates in the form x:y on every line. 
Every other malformed line will be ignored.
e.g:
0:-15
1:-15
2:23
3:243
