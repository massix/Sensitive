SENSITIVE SUITE
---------------

Sensitive is a suite containing two softwares: Inversitive and Sensitive.

Inversitive is a small utility to use along with Sensitive: given a set of coefficients for a
polynom and a domain, it calculates all the points of the domain. The given result is easily
understandable by both a human being and Sensitive. You can drag'n'drop the result directly to
Sensitive to begin an interpolation.

Sensitive is the core software: given a set of coordinates in an infinite domain (R), calculates
the polynom with an user-defined interpolation form (currently Lagrange's or Newton's forms).
If there are more than 10 coordinates set, the resulting polynom may be inaccurate or may have a too 
high degree. As a result of this, the user is asked whether if he'd like to approximate the polynom
using a cubic spline or continue with the standard interpolation form.

Sensitive can also export the whole dataset and plot to a PDF or to a .SNS file.

Sensitive includes also a small server/client protocol (similar to a SYN/ACK handshake) that allows
the user to send coordinates over the air to another Sensitive client.



DEPENDENCIES
------------

Qt >= 4.7.0				(http://qt.nokia.com)
Qwt >= 6.0.0			(http://qwt.sourceforge.net)
Eol-BSpline >= 1.5		(http://www.eol.ucar.edu/~granger/bspline)
g++ >= 4.5.0			(not my fault, Qt 4.7 requires g++ >= 4.5)
snappy >= 1.0.3			(http://code.google.com/p/snappy)

mingw && msys to compile under Windows_NT.



COMPILE
-------

If the dependencies are met, just tune the Qwt_qt_config.makefile in the topmost directory, setting the
paths to where you've installed the libraries. After that just type make (and make install under UNIX if
you'd like to install it, default directory is /usr/local/sensitive, change it by defining a different DESTDIR).

Under Windows, you need to have $MINGW/bin and $MSYS/bin in your path (where $MINGW and $MSYS are the directories
to where you've installed the softwares). There's also included a .nsi file, to compile it you need to have NSIS
installed (and to type "make win32installer")



CREDITS
-------

While I wrote from scratch the two interpolation forms, credits for the Cubic Splines go to Gary Granger
(http://www.eol.ucar.edu/~granger/bspline/doc/index.html).

UI is written using Qt (credits go to Trolltech/Nokia communities) and Qwt (credits go to Uwe Rathmann and 
Josef Wilgen).
